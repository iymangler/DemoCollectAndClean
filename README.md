Here are the data for the project:

Objective for this project is to get mean and standard deviation from the merged training & test data sets and produce a data set and a final descriptive tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Repository contains the following:

This README.md file contains a list of all files. 

a Scriptfile run_analysis.R that gets both train and test data, merges the datasets with activity labels, gets only those variables that represent mean or standard-deviation functions, and then from the result-dataset, creates a tidy dataset which lists the mean calculations of every variable that is in the result-dataset.

a CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data called
